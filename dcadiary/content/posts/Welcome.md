I wanted to do a first hand dollar cost average test by buying Bitcoin each day, so I'll be buying a set amount each day. for the purposes of the experiment and privacy I'll normailise the purchase to £10.00 per day and £100 per day, as well as provide the USD equivalent. I will be factoring fees into my entry price, so it will be the all in price.

How: Each day I'll buy at the time I think I'll get the best price at. I'll review that the following day to see if I was any good. 

When: 1 May 2023 - 30 April 2024

What I'll log (so far - suggestions welcome) :

 - Top news article on Bitcoin for the day, 
 - My perception of the market sentiment,
 - My sentiment,
 - Buy price,
 - current gain/loss
